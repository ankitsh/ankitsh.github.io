Green Day is one of the best punk rock bands ive ever heard. This American Band  consists of three memebers : Billie Joe Armstrong who is singer as well as leading guitarist, Mike Dirnt who is base guitarist & TreCool who is drummer. Indeed, TreCool is considered to be one of the best drummers in the world. Green Day wasnt popular in India in the 90's decade. It gained its popularity from 2004, courtesy to its single 'Bolulevard Of Broken dreams' and since then, its Indian popularity has touched many levels and they are Indian favourites even today.
